Pinoy AgenSee is a dashboard exploration of the poeajobs.ph website, a job portal wherein private employment agencies can post job openings for works abroad. The aim of the dashboard is to provide insights on the status of the labor market for OFWs, mapping agency locations to see if thereâ€™s an accessibility gap, and for an easier comparison of agencies.

The dataset used was scraped from https://poeajobs.ph/ and the period of the data gathered is from January to mid September 2022. After data scraping, data cleaning was employed and then turned into an interactive dashboard via tableau. 

The github folder contains our web scraped data, the pdf copy of our pitch deck, and our dashboard in twbx form.
