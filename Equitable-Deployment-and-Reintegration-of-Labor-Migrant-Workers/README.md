# Equitable Deployment and Reintegration of Labor Migrant Workers

### Introduction

Labor migration especially from third world countries such as the Philippines has always been part of the main areas of concern of the government. With the rising prices of commodities and other essential household needs, more Filipinos are driven to pursue career opportunities abroad in the hopes of earning much higher income to help their family’s daily needs. However, with the increasing number of Filipino migrant laborers, it poses a challenge to the government and embassies to provide the necessary attention to all Overseas Filipino Workers (OFW) and respond to their concerns and needs. This was aggravated when COVID-19, especially on its peak, rattled the global economy, making a lot of jobs of OFWs abroad irrecoverable. In line with this, many OFWs returned to their homes worrying about the state of their family’s future. But amidst the hopes of getting back on their feet, some looming concerns arise: What jobs can they apply for locally given their skills? Can they earn as much in their own home country? Will they be able to live as comfortably as before?

In the efforts of the government to entice OFWs to return to our country, there are several reintegration programs and services that were created to help them rebuild their life especially their career and finances in their own home country after years of working abroad. There are 3 categories for the reintegration program: 1) economic reintegration, 2) social reintegration, and 3) capacity development (Parreno & Mauricio, 2022). However, despite the government having several reintegration programs and services in place, many OFWs are still not aware of these, resulting in repeat migration. This repeat migration is more common in Filipino women, working on elementary occupations but lower wages. They are also more susceptible to labor exploitation such as wage theft and uncovered from social protection, resulting in mental and physical health problems.

With the ongoing difficulty of OFWs to reintegrate and the unequal labor treatment between male and female workers, these are the two problems that we can focus on to solve:

  - Disparity in the salary and benefits received locally vs abroad for the same job and skills as well as minimal financial and capacity building support
  - Unequal labor treatment especially on working conditions and job opportunities for women

With the abovementioned problems, these are the two solutions that can be adapted to begin with:

  - *Labor Deployment Optimization*: This will allow equal treatment and allocation for skills training, job and economic opportunities, and social protection for male and female, which is aligned with ILO Conventions on Migrant Workers: 1) Equality Of Opportunity and Treatment, and 2) Combating Discrimination in Employment And Occupation.
  - *Migration Simulation for Policy Making*: This will allow us to gauge through estimated prediction of the possible effects of reintegration and deployment programs.
