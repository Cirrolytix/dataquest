            <h2> <b>About Dataquest 2022: Gender-Responsive Labor Migration</b> </h2>

            <p> 
            Funded by the Migration Multi-Partner Trust Fund (MPTF) and implemented by IOM, ILO, UN Women in partnership with the Philippine Government, the Bridging Recruitment to Reintegration in Migration Governance (BRIDGE) program aims to support the Government in promoting fair and ethical recruitment, and sustainable reintegration of OFWs in line with the Global Compact for Safe, Orderly, and Regular Migration (GCM). As with the GCM, these objectives should also be achieved in a gender-responsive manner.</p>
              
            <p> 
            On 30 December 2021, the establishment of the Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) [Republic Act 11641] was signed into law.  The newly created DMW shall serve as the lead agency for implementing policies, plans and programs that will ensure the protection, promotion of interests, timely resolution of problems, and effective reintegration of OFWs.  Part of DMW's mandate is to build a Management Information System (MIS), which will serve as a registry for all migrant workers and a source of relevant data for programs and policy formulation.  RA11641 took effect on 3 February 2022, and the implementing rules and regulations (IRR) need to be completed within 75 days from this date (i.e., by 18 April 2022). Thereafter, the MIS is expected to be set up within 6 months of the adoption of the IRR.</p>

            <p> 
            To ensure that ethical design and implementation choices would be made in the creation of the aforesaid MIS, BRIDGE aims to support migration governance agencies through capacity-building and advocacy interventions that will empower their personnel to view data differently, and to care and account for it better by seeing the data through an ethical and moral lens.  One of the two interventions under this initiative is a hackathon / data challenge that will help crowdsource innovative digital solutions to address problems and issues related to labor migration research, as well as migration data ethics and governance.  </p>
